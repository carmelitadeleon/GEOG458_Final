## Summary
This research project investigates the United States state level export product data. Our team seeks to understand the diverse selection of export products, the trends in these exports, as well as the financial significance from different spatial scales. It is through this exploration that we aim to address where the U.S exported goods originate from and why they originate from where they do.

In order to address this research question we have created four different visualizations that measures:
*Export values in the United States in 2017
*Export commodities in the United States in 2017
*Location quotient values for ‘civilian aircraft, engines, and parts’ by state in 2017
*The change over time for the top exporting goods across the U.S. from 2014 to 2017
