evOverview <- "This map displays each US state's export values in millions of dollars.
The gradient color scheme defines how high or low each state's export values are relative
to other states. Clicking on a state reveals a pop up that lists the state's top export
commodity and its share value in 2017 (the % share the top commodity has out of the state's
total exports)."

evAnalysis <- "Based on the map, the top three exporting states are California,
Texas, and New York. Of these three states, New York has the greatest share value
of 15.4462. In second place is Texas with a share value of 8.7495 and in last is 
California with a value of 4.1666. While these three states play a major role in the US’
exporting economy, the degree to which they rely on their top export as a source of revenue
varies widely. Knowing this information can serve as a basis for additional investigation on
the diversification of state economies, why the state and federal government has political
interests in certain industries, and the perceived importance/relevance of a state on a national
level. <br>Observe that states in the Midwest and most of the Western side of the U.S. have a
lower export value in comparison to the Northeast and Southeast of the U.S - this suggests
that the East Coast is immensely important to the US’ exporting economy."

prodOverview <- "The default map shows all 24 export types and the corresponding state
that has that as their top export type. To understand each of the export types more in-depth
, the user has the ability to select and view the shipping commodity individually. By selecting
different commodities through the use of the dropbox, the map will likewise highlight only the
states that have the selected export type as their top export."
